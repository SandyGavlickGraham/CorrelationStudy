# Correlation-Study

This project was a study in some statistics concepts. Specifically covered were:
- Covariance
- Pearson's Correlation
- Spearman's Correlation

Covariance measures the total variation of two random variables from their expected values. Using covariance, we can only gauge the direction of the relationship (whether the variables tend to move in tandem or show an inverse relationship). However, it does not indicate the strength of the relationship, nor the dependency between the variables.

On the other hand, correlation measures the strength of the relationship between variables. Correlation is the scaled measure of covariance. It is dimensionless. In other words, the correlation coefficient is always a pure value and not measured in any units.

## Pearson's Correlation
The Pearson correlation coefficient (named for Karl Pearson) can be used to summarize the strength of the linear relationship between two data samples.

## Spearman's Correlation
Two variables may be related by a nonlinear relationship, such that the relationship is stronger or weaker across the distribution of the variables.

Further, the two variables being considered may have a non-Gaussian distribution.

In this case, the Spearmanâ€™s correlation coefficient (named for Charles Spearman) can be used to summarize the strength between the two data samples. This test of relationship can also be used if there is a linear relationship between the variables, but will have slightly less power (e.g. may result in lower coefficient scores).
